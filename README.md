# ProSocial AI — A System Didactics Modeling Framework

Welcome to **ProSocial AI**, a modeling framework grounded in the theory of **System Didactics (SD)**. This repository introduces a formalisation strategy for building, analysing, and potentially computationally implementing architectures that support prosocial AI design.

## What is this?

ProSocial AI is based on the premise that AI systems should operate within constraint ecologies that reinforce cooperative, viable, and recursively generative interaction. This repository serves as an open platform for:

- sharing formal structures derived from System Didactics,
- developing theoretical models for prosocial cognition and interaction,
- and exploring the viability of these models in applied or computational contexts.

## What is System Didactics?

System Didactics is an interdisciplinary framework that models learning, communication, and constraint propagation within recursive morphodynamic systems. It offers a unique approach to designing and understanding intelligent agents—not just as processors of information, but as participants in shared, viability-oriented constraint ecologies.

## What’s Inside?

This repo will grow to include:
- Formal operator notes and constraint arrays
- Narrative descriptions of morphodynamic processes
- Research fragments from the System Didactics thesis
- Example scaffolds for recursive agent design
- Links to relevant publications, diagrams, and code (if/when added)

## Who’s This For?

Researchers, developers, educators, and curious minds working at the intersection of:
- cognitive architectures
- collaborative AI
- social alignment and affordance theory
- systems pedagogy and constraint design

## Status

This repository is part of an evolving research project. Contributions and questions are welcome as the formal model develops and as new pathways toward computational expression are explored.

Let’s model better minds - together.
